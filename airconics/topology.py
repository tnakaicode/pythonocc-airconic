    Parameters
    ----------
    parts - dictionary
        Should contain the following,
            {name: (Part, arity)}

        i.e. the string 'name' values are presented as a tuple or list of:

                The shape

    Attributes
    ----------
    _Tree - list
        the list of LISP-like instructions (in the order they were called
        with AddPart)

    Notes
    -----
    - warning will be raised if no affinities are provided

    example:
        # (Wing is an airconics Lifting Surface instace):
        aircraft = Topology(parts={'Wing': (Wing['Surface'], 2)})

    Although not enforced, parts should be added to this class recursively
    (from the top node first) to represent the aircraft's flattened
    topological tree suggested by Sobester [1]. It is the users
    responsibility to ensure the input nodes are a valid lisp tree for a
    correct graph to result (no checks are currently performed)
